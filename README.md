# Welcome to OMAR suite of Web Services

## Binary Distribution and Setup

For a quick example on how to configure and setup the new OMAR web services please visit the repo found here [https://github.com/ossimlabs/ossim-vagrant](https://github.com/ossimlabs/ossim-vagrant). The vagrant setup uses salt to provision each web service and is a good example on how to setup a default configuration on a CentOS distribution.  


In this document we will address the following:

* Common settings and configuration.
* Common User and Group
* Settings and configuration for each web service.
* Service Templates init.d
* Service Template systemd 

 


## Common Settings and Configuration

The current binary delivery for all the OMAR web applications is via a yum repository.  Create a repo file in your /etc/yum.repos.d/ossim.repo directory location.  Set the contents of the repo to the following:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/ossim.repo
```

**Create Yum Repo**

```yum
[ossim]
name=CentOS-$releasever - ossim packages for $basearch
baseurl=http://s3.amazonaws.com/o2-rpms/CentOS/$releasever/dev/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
metadata_expire=5m
protect=1
```

Note, in the above **baseurl** variable we have different branches that you can hook into.  In the path you will see a **dev** path http://s3.amazonaws.com/o2-rpms/CentOS/$releasever/**dev**/$basearch.  We also have the **master** branch that is being built and packaged and you can modify this url to use **master**:  http://s3.amazonaws.com/o2-rpms/CentOS/$releasever/**master**/$basearch.  In the future we will have versioned branches that can be setup and installed.  The dev branch could change hourly and so the yum repo for the dev branch might be in the middle of an update when you are accessing the packages.  The master branch will update much less frequently and will only change when a pull request is performed on the dev branch to merge the changes into master.

###Setup EPEL

The [Epel](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) site has links to the EL6, EL7, and EL5 RPM repo installations via RPMs.   We have tested the [EL6 RPM](https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm) with the CentOS 6 distribution and [EL7 RPM](https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm) with the CentOS 7 distribution.

If you need to install epel manually you can install the RPM by using yum command for EL6:

```bash
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm
```

and for EL7:

```bash
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```

###Firewall Settings Using iptables

By default the web applicaiton will come up and listen on port 8080.  Typically we will add the port to the iptables setting to open TCP on port 8080:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables

add the line:

-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
sudo service iptables restart
```
Your resulting iptables should look something similar to but not necessarily exact to the following:

```bash

# Generated by iptables-save v1.4.7 on Fri May  6 13:32:29 2016
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [9:608]
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
-A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
COMMIT
# Completed on Fri May  6 13:32:29 2016
```

### Firewall Settings using firewalld

On CentOS7 they use the firewalld.   To list your zones you can issue the following command:

```bash
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

Output:

public
  interfaces: eth0
```

Now to add port 8080 to the public interface you can execute the following command line application:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
```

Restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart firewalld
```

### SELINUX Configuration

If SELINUX is running you must enable the boolean flag

**httpd\_can\_network_connect**

To list all booleans for httpd and see if your network connect is turned on you can perform the **getsebool** and get output similar to the following:

```bash
/usr/sbin/getsebool -a | grep httpd

Output:

httpd_anon_write --> off
httpd_builtin_scripting --> on
httpd_can_check_spam --> off
httpd_can_connect_ftp --> off
httpd_can_connect_ldap --> off
httpd_can_connect_mythtv --> off
httpd_can_connect_zabbix --> off
httpd_can_network_connect --> on
httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler --> off
httpd_can_network_connect_db --> off
httpd_can_network_memcache --> off
httpd_can_network_relay --> off
httpd_can_sendmail --> off
httpd_dbus_avahi --> off
httpd_dbus_sssd --> off
httpd_dontaudit_search_dirs --> off
httpd_enable_cgi --> on
httpd_enable_ftp_server --> off
httpd_enable_homedirs --> off
:
:
:
:
:
```
To set a boolean you can give the setsebool command:

```bash
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
```

### Common User and Group

We will use our common user name "omar" and create a group with the same name.  We will not create the home account and make this a system user.



```bash
adduser -r -d /usr/share/omar --no-create-home --user-group omar
```

This account will be used for running a service with a common "omar" user name and group.

### Service Templates For init.d
For systems using the startup for init.d we add a file called /et/init.d/\<program_name>.  The template contents should look similar to the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# chkconfig: 3 80 20
# Provides: General service wrapper for {{program_name}} services
# Required-Start: $network $syslog
# Required-Stop: $network $syslog

* **{{program_name}}** is replaced by the web service name:  For example wmts-app.
* **{{program_user}}** is replaced by the user.  In this case the username is *omar*.
* **{{program_group}}** is replaced by the group name.  In this case we use the group name *omar*.

If you were creating a startup script for wmts-app then all occurances of the pattern {{program_name}} would be replaced with wmts-app.


### Service Templates For Systemd

All systemd startup scripts will be setup and installed in the location /usr/lib/systemd/system/<app-name>.service.   The contents of each systemd servcie file will look something like the following:

```bash
[Service]
PermissionsStartOnly=true
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/{{program_name}}/{{program_name}}.pid
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "/usr/share/omar/{{program_name}}/{{program_name}}.sh /var/run/{{program_name}}/{{program_name}}.pid >> /var/log/{{program_name}}/{{program_name}}.log 2>&1" &
User={{program_user}}
Group={{program_group}}
WorkingDirectory=/usr/share/omar/{{program_name}}
Restart=on-abort
```
* **{{program_name}}** is replaced by the web service name:  For example wmts-app.
* **{{program_user}}** is replaced by the user.  In this case the username is *omar*.
* **{{program_group}}** is replaced by the group name.  In this case we use the group name *omar*.

All web application are installed under the /usr/share/omar/\<program_name> directory.


### Common Database

We typically use a common database server to store any service specific table data.  Within this installation we have tested against a Postgres database server.  All services will have a common configuration entry in their yaml file that contains an entry of the form:

```yaml
environments:
  production:
    dataSource:
      pooled: true
      jmxExport: true
      driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
      username: postgres
      password:
      dialect: 'org.hibernate.spatial.dialect.postgis.PostgisDialect'
      url: jdbc:postgresql://<ip>:<port>/omardb-prod

```
In each of the individual services documentation they will describe further where their configuration yaml file is located. The above **dataSource** defines Postgres as our connecting source and we assume a postgres instance is setup for us to connect to.  In the connection you will need to specify the **url** to connect to and so the **ip** and **port** will need to be replaced with your database server instance. Postgres typically defaults to **port** 5432. Depending on how the authentication is setup you will need to specify the **username** and **password**.

## Web Service Configuration

We have seen the common settings found on all of the Web Application Services.  In this section please follow the specific configuration for each web application.  The documentation will assume that the common settings have been applied and will not be repeated.  We will show all files/directories required to run the web service.
